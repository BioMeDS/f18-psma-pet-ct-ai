# TotalSegmentator results

This folder contains one subfolder per subject with the two files `prostate.nii.gz` and `urinary_bladder.nii.gz` contining the masks for these two classes.
These files are used to crop the pet and ct files around the prostate (if possible) or around the urinary bladder (otherwise).
The files are not included in the repository, because it is unclear (to us) whether they constitute personal data.
